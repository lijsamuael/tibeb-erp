# Tibeb ERP - Project Setup and Branch Management

## Project Overview

This project contains multiple apps, including **Frappe**, **ERPNext**, and **HRMS**, each managed in separate branches. Instead of cloning the whole repository, each app is maintained independently, and you will pull each branch separately based on the app you need.
